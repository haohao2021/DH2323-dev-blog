                    <p>
                        In the beginning, when I found Daniel Shiffman's new
                        coding challenge about stippling, I thought of
                        Pointillism, a painting technique pioneered by French
                        artist Georges Seurat during the Post-Impressionist
                        period. Therefore, my initial project proposal was to
                        extend the stippling project into a Pointillism filter
                        app—just applying the color method Seurat used in his
                        works. However, after a deeper dive into some papers
                        about digital Pointillism, I realized that stippling and
                        Pointillism are totally different painting methods, and
                        therefore the digital methods to generate them with a
                        computer are also totally different. The methods
                        computer scientists use to generate Pointillism-style
                        images are too complex for me and for this course
                        project, so I decided to focus only on stippling.

                        Delaunator
                    </h3>
                    <img src="delaunay.png" alt="Delaunay Triangulation" />
                    <p>
                        Initially, I wanted to create my project as a
                        single-page web app that allows users to upload images
                        and get filtered stippling images with a control panel
                        to adjust some parameters. I quickly made this with
                        Next.js. For manipulating pixels, I chose p5.js, which
                        I'm familiar with and is popular in the web development
                        field. For calculating Delaunay triangles based on a
                        group of points, I chose Mapbox's Delaunator because it
                        performs the fastest in comparison.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The first step was to generate a group of random points
                        from the input image by setting a brightness threshold
                        for each pixel. Then, I used the Delaunator library's
                        function to easily get the Delaunay triangles.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        result was quite good, and it really ran fast as
                        expected!

                    <p>
                        Compared with d3-delaunay, which was used by Daniel
                        Shiffman in his project, Mapbox's Delaunator is a
                        relatively low-level library without an API to generate
                        Voronoi diagrams directly. Therefore, I decided to code
                        the algorithm myself.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The Vertices of Voronoi polygons are just the
                        circumcenters of Delaunay triangles. Using the formula
                        on this website: [Circumcenter of a
                        Triangle](https://byjus.com/maths/circumcenter-of-a-triangle/),
                        I completed the calculateVoronoi function.

                        03. Optimize Points Distribution with Lloyd's Algorithm
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        The most important part of the paper
                        <em>Weighted Voronoi Stippling</em> is about Lloyd's
                        algorithm. The basic idea is to calculate the centroids
                        of each Voronoi cell or polygon and move the
                        corresponding point to its location, then generate a new
                        Voronoi diagram and repeat this process until a stable
                        point distribution is achieved, resulting in the final
                        stippling image.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To implement this in code, I got help from
                        <a href="https://paulbourke.net/geometry/polygonmesh/"
                            >Paul Bourke's website</a
                        >
                        on how to calculate the centroid coordinate of a
                        polygon.

                    <img src="centroid-formula.png" alt="Centroid Formula" />
                    <p>
                        To calculate the weights of each pixel based on its
                        brightness, I referred to
                        <a
                            href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/Relative_luminance"
                            >W3C's definition of Relative Luminance</a
                        >: "For the sRGB color space, the relative luminance of
                        a color is defined as L = 0.2126 * R + 0.7152 * G +
                        0.0722 * B".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With the knowledge above, I finished the updatePoints
                        function. The final program could run, but it ran very
                        slowly, which I thought might be related to some
                        performance or compatibility issues with p5.js. It might
                        only perform better on its official web editor. So, I
                        migrated my algorithm to a p5.js web editor sketch. The
                        final result was relatively satisfactory.

                    />
                    <p>
                        The face part of this portrait is not good, which I
                        think is because of insufficient grayscale contrast. An
                        image with stronger grayscale contrast may perform
                        better.
